# Renewable Energy Consumption Forecasting
The global transition towards renewable energy has been a hot topic in recent years due to concerns about climate change and energy security. To further understand the trends and patterns of renewable energy consumption over time, this proposal aims to analyze a time series dataset of total renewable consumption.

The dataset consists of monthly time series data from the United States Energy Information Administration (https://www.eia.gov/) and includes data on the consumption of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass combined.

We plan to compare the forecasting accuracy of at least three different model categories, such as regression, ARIMA, and exponential smoothing. The project aims to provide insights into the growth and potential of renewable energy consumption, as well as identify any challenges or limitations in the adoption of renewable energy sources. The findings could inform policy decisions and provide valuable information for businesses and individuals seeking to invest in renewable energy.
